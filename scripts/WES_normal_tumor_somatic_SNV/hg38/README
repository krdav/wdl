Suggested workflow for somatic variant calling on paired normal/tumor samples using the hg38 reference genome.

This workflow is experimental in the way that it is not updated to same extent as its hg37 counterpart.
This is due to reference datasets (such as gnomad and exac) are not yet available for hg38.
