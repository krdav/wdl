# Python parser for WDL

The file `wdl_parser.py` provides a WDL parser for Python. This parser is currently unsupported, so caveat emptor. We believe it will work but do not have the resources to validate this claim. If you encounter difficult using this parser and are willing to help us fix the issue we'll work with you to do so.

To generate a new version of the parser simply type `make` in this directory.
